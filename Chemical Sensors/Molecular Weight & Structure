Molecular Weight & Chem Structure 
Fentanyl: A synthetic opioid analgesic with the molecular formula C22H28N2O. 

Molecular Weight:
The molecular weight of fentanyl can be calculated by summing the atomic weights of its constituent atoms:
Molecular Weight = (22 * Atomic Weight of Carbon) + (28 * Atomic Weight of Hydrogen) + (2 * Atomic Weight of Nitrogen) + Atomic Weight of Oxygen

Using standard atomic weights:
Molecular Weight = (22 * 12.011) + (28 * 1.008) + (2 * 14.007) + 15.999 â‰ˆ 336.47 g/mol
***Therefore, the approximate molecular weight of fentanyl is around 336.47 grams per mole.***

Chemical Structure:
Fentanyl has a complex chemical structure, and its common name is N-(1-phenethyl-4-piperidinyl)-N-phenylpropanamide. 
Key components of the structure:
- Phenethylamine Backbone: The core structure of fentanyl includes a phenethylamine backbone.
- Piperidine Ring: Fentanyl contains a piperidine ring, which is a heterocyclic ring structure.
- Propanamide Functional Group: Fentanyl has a propanamide functional group attached to the nitrogen atom.
- Acetyl Group: An acetyl group (CH3CO-) is attached to the nitrogen atom.
- Aromatic Rings: Fentanyl contains aromatic rings, contributing to its overall molecular structure.
