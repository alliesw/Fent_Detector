physical properties of fentanyl

State:
Physical State: Fentanyl is typically encountered as a white to off-white crystalline powder or as a solid.
Solid Form: Fentanyl is often synthesized and distributed in its solid form, which can take the shape of powder or crystals.

Odor:
Odorless: Fentanyl is reported to be nearly odorless, which can make its detection challenging based on smell alone.

Melting and Boiling Points:
Melting Point: The melting point of fentanyl is approximately 87-88 degrees Celsius (189-190 degrees Fahrenheit).
Boiling Point: Fentanyl is not commonly used in applications where its boiling point is a critical factor.

Solubility:
Water Solubility: Fentanyl is sparingly soluble in water.
Solubility in Other Solvents: It is more soluble in organic solvents such as ethanol and methanol.

Density:
Density of Solid Form: The density of fentanyl in its solid form is approximately 1.24 g/cmÂ³.

Vapor Pressure:
Vapor Pressure: Fentanyl is expected to have a low vapor pressure, given its solid or powder form at room temperature.

Appearance:
Color: Fentanyl is commonly encountered as a white to off-white powder or crystalline substance.
Texture: The texture can vary from fine powder to small crystals.

Stability:
Stability: Fentanyl can be stable under certain conditions, but its stability can be affected by factors such as exposure to light, heat, and moisture.
Physical Form:

Solid Form: Fentanyl is often distributed and encountered in its solid form.
Crystallinity: Fentanyl may exist in a crystalline structure, and the size of crystals can impact various properties.
