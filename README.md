# Fent_Detector-
Purpose: Develop an Advanced Detection Technology for Fentanyl & a DB for Related Analytics. Proposal: A Healthcare IT-based scanner that can detect fentanyl in an entire pill - rather than using a test-strip that is only able to provide results for the portion of the pill being tested. 

Often when people test their illicit narcotics for fentanyl, they use a test-strip on only one pill out of their supply or a portion of one pill - of which 1 out of 99 could contain fent, or alternatively testing a 1/2 of a single pill - 1/2 could test negative for fent, while the other half tests positive - thus only providing partial results. 

The use of an advanced detection technology that is able to scan and detect fent in an entire pill or an entire batch would provide more accurate and helpful intel, and illiminate the need to test pills individually or portions of a single pill - which only is able to provide partial results of the presence of fent in an entire batch.
