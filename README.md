**Project**: Advanced fentanyl detection system with Scanning Mechanism: A rapid, nonintrusive detection tool for public use.       
**Purpose**: Develop an Advanced Detection Technology for Fentanyl & a DB for Related Analytics. 
**Proposal**: A Healthcare IT-based scanner that can detect fentanyl in an entire pill - rather than using a test-strip that is only able to provide results for the portion of the pill being tested. Often when testing illicit narcotics for fentanyl, the person will use a test-strip and perform it on only one pill out of their entire supply or a portion of one pill. Given the high possibility that 1 out of 99 pills could contain fent, or alternatively when testing a 1/2 of a single pill - 1/2 could test negative for fent, while the other half tests positive, it is impossible to provide 100% accurate results without testing the entirety of ones supply. Hence, the use of test-strips often only yeild partial results - as it doesn't make financial sense for suppliers or users of illicit narcotics to use test-strips on their entire supply. 

Thus, the use of an advanced detection technology that is able to scan and detect fent in an entire pill or an entire batch would provide a more safe and accurate means of testing illicit drugs than the use of test-strips. While the results may be the same, this technology would illiminate the need to test pills individually or portions of a single pill - which is unsafe due to the potential presence of fent and partial results accrued through current testing methods.    

**Proposed Key components and methods that could be incorporated into the detection systems:**
1. Chemical Sensors
* Highly Selective Sensors: Develop sensors that are highly selective to fentanyl molecules. This can involve using specific receptors or functional groups that have a strong affinity for fentanyl.
* Nanotechnology: Utilize nanomaterials to enhance sensor sensitivity. Nanoparticles or nanocomposites can be functionalized to selectively interact with fentanyl.

2. Spectroscopy Techniques
* Mass Spectrometry: Employ mass spectrometry techniques for precise identification & quantification of fentanyl. This can include time-of-flight mass spectrometry for rapid and accurate results.
* Infrared Spectroscopy: Use infrared spectroscopy to detect fentanyl based on its unique molecular vibrations.

3. Machine Learning Algorithms:
* Pattern Recognition: Implement machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition. Train the system to recognize the unique signature of fentanyl in various environments.
* Data Fusion: Combine data from multiple sensors and sources to enhance detection accuracy. Machine learning models can integrate information from chemical sensors, spectroscopy, and other inputs.

4. Real-time Monitoring Systems:
* Continuous Monitoring: Develop systems that can continuously monitor the environment for fentanyl presence. This is crucial for early detection & prevention of potential harm.
* Wireless Communication: Enable real-time communication capabilities to alert authorities or relevant personnel when fentanyl is detected.

5. Portable Devices:
* Field-Deployable Sensors: Create portable and field-deployable devices for use in various settings, including law enforcement operations, border control, and public events.
* User-Friendly Interfaces: Design interfaces that are easy to use and interpret, enabling non-experts to operate the detection technology effectively.

6. Integration with Existing Systems:
